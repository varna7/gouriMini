# Approach

For testing of the application, we followed a reactive approach, it means that we tested our application after the build. Dynamic and heuristics strategy is followed for finding possible defects through test cases. The test cases are applied manually.

# Review of Gap Analysis Table

After seeing similar work, we tend to infer that applications that are made to date are either restricted to provide bound services or restricted to provide services from the company's platform. We can also additionally infer that Sukoon[1] business model relies on staff who offer services.
